This project was the final project for Advanced Programming, completed Summer 2012.

The proffessor provided two files:
+ cities
+ shortest

cities contains two city names with corrisponding grid corrdinates on each line.
shortest contains two city names per line.

This project involves the following:
+ Reading in a file
+ Parsing the lines of the file
+ Creating a graph
+ Calculating azimuth and direction between cities
+ Use of Spherical Geometry
+ Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm
+ Reproducing shortest path between to cities
