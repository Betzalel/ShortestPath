This project was the final project for Advanced Programming, completed Summer 2012.

The proffessor provided two files:
 o cities
 o shortest

cities contains two city names with corrisponding grid corrdinates on each line.
shortest contains two city names per line.

This project involves the following:
 o Reading in a file
 o Parsing the lines of the file
 o Creating a graph
 o Calculating azimuth and direction between cities
   - Use of Spherical Geometry
 o Implementing Dijkstra's algorithm
 o Reproducing shortest path between to cities
